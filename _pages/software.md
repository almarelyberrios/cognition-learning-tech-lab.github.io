As part of our research we develop and contribute to software tools that help improve the ways we do research. 

These tools are aimed at:
- facilitating the preparation of stimuli for research studies
- facilitating designing different aspects of the research cycle (e.g., counterbalancing)
- improving the way we collect data, by allowing to collect data more efficiently while minimizing
the burden of researchers and research participants
- allowing to collect new kinds of data (e.g., RT where only accuracy was collected)

All the research software tools we develop are built in a way to make them easy to use and easy to maintain. The projects are always open to new contributors and are beginner-friendly, so do not hesitate in contacting me if you are interested.  

This is a selective list of software projects that we maintain 
or contribute to. Please see Github to find a more complete list.
