Our team’s work focuses on 5 general aims that address our goal:
 
**Understand neuropsychological functioning**
We study healthy persons to understand how neuropsychological functioning supports complex activities and learning. We are particularly interested in how we use several neuropsychological functions simultaneously to produce complex behavior and learn in formal and informal settings. For example, our team works on identifying the neuropsychological functions that are particularly important for goal-oriented behavior, academic success, learning to design research studies, learning computational skills, and learning inferential thinking.

**Understand the effect of mental and physical illness on neuropsychological functioning**
We study how specific mental (e.g., ADHD) and physical (e.g., diabetes) illnesses impact neuropsychological functioning. We are particularly interested in the neuropsychological mechanisms through which specific mental and physical illnesses impact behavioral, academic, and health outcomes. Our team asks questions like do people with ADHD have greater odds of developing diabetes because they have difficulties with goal-oriented behavior?
 
**Improve neuropsychological measurement and assessment**
We study how appropriate are currently available instruments for measuring neuropsychological functioning and how can they be improved. We also develop new instruments to address gaps in research and applied settings, particularly by implementing technology and data driven approaches to improve the way neuropsychological functioning is measured and assessed. For example, most procedures for measuring simple verbal working memory spans only calculate the maximum length span using digit spans. Could collecting (e.g., reaction times, spontaneous self-correction) or calculating other types of data (e.g., mean span) help improve our understanding of verbal working memory and improve differential diagnoses?
 
**Improve neuropsychological interventions**
We study how to improve the cost-effectiveness of neuropsychological interventions that can improve behavioral and health outcomes. We also develop new interventions to address gaps in applied settings, particularly interventions that are flexible, easy to implement, and data driven. Our team addresses questions like will the intervention remain its effectiveness if we implement fewer sessions or shorter sessions? Could we develop a simplified version of the intervention that can be implemented at home? Should we vary the intervention’s difficulty level or types of stimuli?
 
**Develop tools to improve research**
We develop software tools that improve the way scientists study neuropsychological functioning. By developing these tools we aim to advance research in two main ways: (a) by facilitating research procedures  and (b) developing innovative ways to address hard questions in science. For example, we develop software tools that facilitate the process of building stimuli pools. We share these tools as open-source software projects so be sure to visit the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/software">software section</a> for more information.
